# One-shot watchtower sweep: sends the sweep prompt to the OpenClaw agent in
# a single non-interactive turn. Useful for ad-hoc runs and for debugging the
# same prompt that the OpenClaw Cron Job runs on schedule.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/sweep.sh [watchlist-path]
#
# The watchlist path is relative to the agent workspace inside the sandbox
# (default: watchlists/regulatory.yaml). Override the sandbox with
# NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX_NAME (default: watchtower).

# No --local: NemoClaw sandboxes reject it (it would bypass the gateway's
# managed inference route, secret scanning, and network policy).
