# Step 1 of 2: non-interactively onboard an OpenClaw sandbox with Tavily as
# the web-search provider. Scripts THROUGH `nemoclaw onboard`, not around it:
# this script only validates .env, exports the documented non-interactive
# answer variables, and hands off to the wizard. Onboarding wires the
# built-in web_search tool to Tavily, stores the key as an OpenShell provider
# placeholder, and applies the Tavily egress policy — nothing else needed.
#
# Idempotent: if the sandbox already exists, prints its status and exits 0.
#
# Try after this script:
#   $ nemoclaw watchtower status
#   $ bash scripts/install.sh
