# Optional Hermes Auto-Heal

This is an opt-in reliability add-on for a running Hermes sandbox. It is not a
replacement for the normal first-time setup. Finish the README's OpenShell,
`.env`, and `bash scripts/bring-up.sh` steps first, including the one-time
Outlook device login when Outlook is enabled. The first image build can take
several minutes.

The add-on installs only **user-level** systemd units. It never copies API
keys into unit files and it does not need a root-owned service. On a headless
host, enable linger once so your user services continue after logout:

```console
$ sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

## First-time installation

From the example directory, run the read-only preflight first:

```console
$ bash scripts/autoheal/install.sh --check
```

It checks the user systemd manager, Docker, OpenShell, Python, `.env`, a Ready
sandbox, and the Hermes gateway. Fix any failed check, then install:

```console
$ bash scripts/autoheal/install.sh
$ bash scripts/autoheal/sanity-check.sh
```

The installer enables a host gateway forward, a watchdog timer, and a Slack
response-monitor timer. It also enables a TLS proxy service when you configured
one.

## Optional Inference Hub proxy

Use this only when the sandbox endpoint is routed through the host proxy:

```bash
NEMOCLAW_ENDPOINT_URL=http://host.openshell.internal:18080/v1
NEMOCLAW_HOST_TLS_PROXY_UPSTREAM=https://inference-api.nvidia.com
NEMOCLAW_HOST_TLS_PROXY_PORT=18080
```

`NEMOCLAW_HOST_TLS_PROXY_UPSTREAM` is intentionally explicit. It is the HTTPS
origin that the host proxy reaches; the sandbox-facing endpoint stays the
`host.openshell.internal` URL. The installer refuses to manage this proxy when
the sandbox endpoint uses port `18080` but the upstream is missing.

## What runs

| Unit | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `nemoclaw-hermes-proxy.service` | Keeps the optional host TLS inference proxy running. |
| `nemoclaw-hermes-gateway-forward.service` | Keeps `127.0.0.1:8642` forwarded to the sandbox Hermes gateway. |
| `nemoclaw-hermes-watchdog.timer` | Runs health checks every minute and performs bounded recovery. |
| `nemoclaw-slack-response-monitor.timer` | Detects unanswered allowed-user Slack DMs and recent transport errors every minute. |

Recovery first restarts the affected host service or Hermes gateway. It rebuilds
the sandbox only after a live Slack Socket Mode or Microsoft Graph probe confirms
that sandbox egress is failing. Locks and cooldowns prevent repeated rebuilds.

## Manual operation

```console
$ bash scripts/autoheal/sanity-check.sh
$ bash scripts/autoheal/sanity-check.sh --repair
$ systemctl --user status nemoclaw-hermes-gateway-forward.service
$ systemctl --user list-timers 'nemoclaw-*'
$ journalctl --user -u nemoclaw-hermes-watchdog.service -n 80 --no-pager
$ journalctl --user -u nemoclaw-slack-response-monitor.service -n 80 --no-pager
```

`sanity-check.sh` only reports health by default. `--repair` runs the watchdog
after reporting failures. It does not print credentials.

To stop and remove the optional add-on without touching the sandbox, providers,
or host data services:

```console
$ bash scripts/autoheal/uninstall.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`install.sh --check` says the user manager is unavailable:** reconnect to
  the host after enabling linger, or export `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)`
  in the current shell.
- **The proxy service is absent:** configure
  `NEMOCLAW_HOST_TLS_PROXY_UPSTREAM` only when you intentionally use the host
  proxy, then rerun the installer.
- **A Slack message still receives no reply:** run the sanity check, then share
  the non-secret watchdog and response-monitor log lines with the operator.
- **Outlook Graph remains unavailable after recovery:** confirm normal Outlook
  delegate access and provider setup using the README; auto-heal cannot repair
  an expired sign-in or missing mailbox permissions.
